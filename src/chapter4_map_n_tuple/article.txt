Package structure

The scala package contains core types.

scala.collection and its subpackages contain a collections framework with
higher-order functions for manipulation. Both scala.collection.immutable and
scala.collection.mutable data structures are available, with immutable as the
default. The scala.collection.parallel collections provide automatic parallel
operation.
